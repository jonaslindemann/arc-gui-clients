The ARC Graphical Clients is an attempt of creating a set of graphical client tools for using the ARC middleware. The tools covers certificate handling, proxy creating, job submission and storage. The main idea is to create a set of tools that can be used together or separately, depending on the need of the users. 

All tools have been implemented using the Qt user interface library, to make them portable on all platforms such as Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Currently only Linux and to a limited extent Mac OS X clients are available. As soon as the Windows port of ARC have been finalised it should be possible to compiler these client tools to this platform as well.
